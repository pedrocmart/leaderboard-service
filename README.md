# Description
Your task is to implement a service that maintains a "real-time" ranking of users playing a specific game. 

Requirements:

<ul>
	<li>Clients submit user scores when they achieve important milestones in the game&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Clients can submit absolute scores or relative scores, for example: {"user" :123, "total": 250}, or {"user": 456, "score": "+10"}, or {"user": 789, score: "-20"}</li>
	<li>Any client can request the ranking at any time, using one of the following requests:</li>
	<li>Absolute ranking, for example: Top100, Top200, Top500</li>
	<li>Relative ranking, for instance: At100/3, meaning 3 users around position 100th of the ranking, that is positioned 97th, 98th, 99th, 100th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd</li>
</ul>

<p>We propose that it have the following endpoints:</p>
<ul>
	<li>[POST] user/{user_id}/score</li>
	<li>[GET] ranking?type=top100</li>
	<li>[GET] ranking?type=At100/3</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We prefer&nbsp;you to develop the test in one of the main&nbsp;languages we use at SP (PHP or Golang)&nbsp;but if you don't&nbsp;feel comfortable enough with them, feel free to choose any other</li>
	<li>
<strong>Do&nbsp;not couple yourself to a&nbsp;specific framework</strong>, as the test is pretty simple we prefer to see how big is your knowledge of what goes under the hood</li>
	<li>
<strong>Do not use any database or external storage system</strong>, just keep the ranking <strong>in-memory</strong> (NB if you use a stateless language&nbsp;there's no need to keep this storage anywhere after the process dies)</li>
	<li>
<strong>The code must work and sort</strong> as specified in this document</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals to evaluate</h3>

<ul>
	<li>How you approach the project (we left some stuff &nbsp;intentionally open, so you have to evaluate trade-offs and make some decisions)</li>
	<li>How you design and architecture the system&nbsp;</li>
	<li>How you test and ensure the overall quality of the solution</li>
</ul>


<h3>Nice to have</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Docker with docker-compose</li>
	<li>Readme to explain how we can check the code</li>
	<li>Testing with full code coverage or important code for you</li>
</ul>

# Solution

<a id="explaining"></a>
## Explaining a little bit of the code:

In the `main.go` file, I initialize the Core struct. This is going to be used throughout the whole code, containing the services, store, and request response. This last one is an interface that can handle errors, responses and read JSON body. 
Further, the NewCoreService will return an implementation of the HTTP interface which is a collection of HTTP functions.
After that, I create an in-memory database, and finally connect the handlers to my router. 
I have also a NotFound handler, to make sure the service can be accessed only from the two APIs provided.

When it comes to interfaces, we have a Service interface, which handles Submit Score and Get Ranking, a Store interface, responsible for all the database queries and transactions, and a Request Response interface, as previously explained.

The unit tests were implemented for the core services and handlers. `moq` was used to mock responses and errors.

A Makefile was added to make life easier when running command lines :) 

The [APIs](#APIs) describes more when it comes to business rules decisions that were left open intentionally.

**Enjoy! :)**

<a id="APIs"></a>
## APIs
<a id="post"></a>
### **[POST] user/{user_id}/score**

Since we can have two different submissions for the user (absolute or relative), the body must contain only one option, as described below:
<a id="postabsolute"></a>
#### **Absolute Score:**
Must be sent with the integer `total`. This will set the user's total score.

If the `user_id` sent didn't exist in the database, a new user will be created.

**Example:**

`[POST]` http://0.0.0.0:8894/user/1/score

`[JSON Body]`
```
{
    "total": 100
}
```

<a id="postrelative"></a>
#### **Relative Score:**
Must be sent with the string `score`. This will add or subtracts from user's score, depending on the first character sent. The API only accepts `score` which starts with `+` or `-`.

The user can have a negative score.

If the `user_id` sent didn't exist in the database, a new user will be created.

**Example:**

`[POST]` http://0.0.0.0:8894/user/1/score

`[JSON Body]`
```
{
    "score": "+20"
}
```

Response:

For both scenarios, the response will be the same, in case of success. A JSON containing the `user_id`, and the current `score`.
```
{
    "user_id": 1,
    "score": 100
}
```





<a id="get"></a>
### **[GET] ranking?type={type}**
In order to request the ranking, you need to set what kind of ranking do you want to see: absolute or relative. That said, the API will only accept the followin types as a parameter:

<a id="getabsolute"></a>
#### **Absolute Ranking:**

In this scenario, you must use the type `top`, followed by the number of users that you want in the ranking. The number must be greater than 0.


**Example:**

Below we define `type` as `top3`, meaning that we want the 3 top players from our ranking.

`[GET]` http://0.0.0.0:8894/ranking?type=top3

Response:
```
{
    "ranking": [
        {
            "position": 1,
            "user_id": 3,
            "score": 452
        },
        {
            "position": 2,
            "user_id": 2,
            "score": 101
        },
        {
            "position": 3,
            "user_id": 1,
            "score": 5
        }
    ]
}
```


<a id="getrelative"></a>
#### **Relative Ranking:**

In this scenario, you must use the type `at`, followed by the position you want in the ranking, a `/`, and a number of users around that position. Both numbers must be greater than 0.

**Example:**

Below we define `type` as `at10/2`, meaning 2 users around position 10th of the ranking, that is positioned 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th.

`[GET]` http://0.0.0.0:8894/ranking?type=at10/2

Response:
```
{
    "ranking": [
        {
            "position": 7,
            "user_id": 12,
            "score": 34
        },
        {
            "position": 8,
            "user_id": 7,
            "score": 27
        },
        {
            "position": 9,
            "user_id": 9,
            "score": 24
        },
        {
            "position": 10,
            "user_id": 8,
            "score": 19
        },
        {
            "position": 11,
            "user_id": 4,
            "score": 2
        },
        {
            "position": 12,
            "user_id": 5,
            "score": -72
        }
    ]
}
```
Edge case:
If you set your type as `at1/3`, you'll see the the top 1 user, and the 3 users next to her/him.
